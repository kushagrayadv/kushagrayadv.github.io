title: "Model Implementations"

I've been building some really cool deep learning models from the ground up! I've focused on replicating well-known architectures, and by coding each layer and connection myself, I've gained a deep understanding of how these models work and how to build complex networks.

### List of Implementations:

- [VGG-16](https://github.com/Billa-Man/model-implementations-from-scratch/blob/main/vgg_16.py)
- [VGG-19](https://github.com/Billa-Man/model-implementations-from-scratch/blob/main/vgg_19.py)
- [FCN (8s, 16s, 32s)](https://github.com/Billa-Man/model-implementations-from-scratch/blob/main/fcn.py)
- [U-Net](https://github.com/Billa-Man/model-implementations-from-scratch/blob/main/unet.py)
- [Vision Transformer](https://github.com/Billa-Man/model-implementations-from-scratch/blob/main/vit.py)
