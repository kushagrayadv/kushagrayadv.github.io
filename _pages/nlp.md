      <ul>
        <li>Provided a comprehensive solution the problem of harassment against women in public space.</li>
        <li>Leveraged sentence analysis on data from safecity.in to assess location safety. Employed geocoding for coordinates retrieval and calculated risk based on nearby crime severity. Utilised graph algorithms to recommend the safest routes for women travelers.</li>
        <li>2nd Runner-up in HackFest 2023. The project was discussed during a session in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Given a dataset containing passages, questions and themes, built a robust model to predict the answer. It was able to detect unanswerable questions as well.</li>
        <li>Developed the model using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0, consisting of <b>100,000 questions</b>.</li>
        <li>Began with the Retro-Reader architecture as a baseline, and subsequently implemented a Retriever-Reader methodology enriched with re-Ranking and Contrastive Loss techniques.</li>
        <li><b>Accuracy: </b>74% (Finetuned RoBERTa tiny) | <b>82%</b> (Finetuned RoBERTa base) | Achieved on limited 12GB RAM in the absence of hardware accelerators.</li>
