# Welcome to My Project Portfolio!

I transform ideas into intelligent systems. Each category represents a different approach to solving complex problems:

- ðŸ§  [Large Language Models]({% link _pages/llm.md %}) - Teaching machines to understand and generate human language
- ðŸ”„ [Multimodal Learning]({% link _pages/multimodal.md %}) - Bridging the gap between different types of data
- ðŸ‘€ [Computer Vision]({% link _pages/cv.md %}) - Giving machines the ability to see and interpret the world
- âš¡ [Big Data]({% link _pages/big-data.md %}) - Turning massive datasets into actionable insights
- ðŸš€ [Full stack]({% link _pages/full-stack.md %}) -  Building complete solutions from concept to deployment

Each project includes source code, technical documentation, and demos.

### Featured Quick Builds:

- Computer Vision Experiments [Real-time face detection](https://github.com/kushagrayadv/face-detection-with-OpenCV) \| [GAN image creator](https://github.com/kushagrayadv/GAN-image-creation) \| [Digit Recognizer using Keras](https://github.com/kushagrayadv/digit-recognizer-with-keras)
- Classification Challenges [MNIST Classification](https://github.com/kushagrayadv/mnist-classification) \| [CIFAR Classification](https://github.com/kushagrayadv/CIFAR-Image-Classification)

Each built to explore specific ML techniques and frameworks
